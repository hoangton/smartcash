"Everyone can create a proposal that helps SmartCash in some way. Then "
"every SmartCash holder also can participate in the voting process and "

"Smartcard (:ref:`smartcard-getting-started`) Debit and credit card "
"payments have become the dominant way for many to carry out most, if not "

"increasingly simple for small businesses and now quick and affordable "
"smartphone-powered solutions have widespread adoption. SmartCard emerged "
"offering to solve many of the problems traditional payment systems are "
"facing such as long settlement times, chargebacks, and high fees. "
"SmartCard is a blockchain-based solution that aims to improve on the "
"digital payment card model. Our main goals are to streamline crypto "
"transactions and make them practical for use in real-life payment "
"scenarios. At the same time we aim to drastically reduce fees and "
"confirmation time frames over those found in current solutions. The "
"SmartCard makes it possible to pay with SmartCash using a physical card "
"where no mobile wallet or phone internet access is required. Since the "
"SmartCard doesn’t use a bank or a credit card processor, transactions are"
" not subject to any restrictions. Merchants will have a point of sale "
"(POS) app, so they transmit transactions for you but can’t initiate the "
"payment without your permission. For further information about how the "
